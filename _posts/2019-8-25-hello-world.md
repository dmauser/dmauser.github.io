title: Hello World

This fist post I would like to thanks Paulo Marques who for together a really good amount of resources on how to build a Blog site using GitPages. The only change I made in mine was to use Emerald Template. If you want to setup the same type of blog, I really recommend you leverage his recommendations: https://paulomarquesc.github.io/Hello-World-Paulo/

Enjoy!
