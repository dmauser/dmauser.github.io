This fist post I would like to thanks Paulo Marques for putting together a really good amount of resources on how to build a Blog site using GitPages. The only change I made in mine was to use [Jekyll Emerald Template](http://www.jacoporabolini.com/emerald/). If you want to setup the same type of blog,I really recommend you leverage his recommendations: url: <http://paulomarquesc.github.io/Hello-World-Paulo>

Enjoy!
