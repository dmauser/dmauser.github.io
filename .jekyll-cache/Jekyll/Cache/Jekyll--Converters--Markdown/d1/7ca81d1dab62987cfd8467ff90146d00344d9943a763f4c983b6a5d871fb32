I"ö<p>This fist post I would like to thanks Paulo Marques for putting together a really good amount of resources on how to build a Blog site using GitPages. The only change I made in mine was to use <a href="http://www.jacoporabolini.com/emerald/">Jekyll Emerald Template</a>. If you want to setup the same type of blog, I really recommend you leverage his recommendations: <a href="http://paulomarquesc.github.io/Hello-World-Paulo">http://paulomarquesc.github.io/Hello-World-Paulo</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
